# interactive-web-game
This is an interactive point and click website only using HTML and Bootstrap.

This is a simple interactive point and click web game in which I created as a class project to learn
the basics of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The main idea of this project was to learn about these technologies
and to understand how to apply them to create an interactive story.
